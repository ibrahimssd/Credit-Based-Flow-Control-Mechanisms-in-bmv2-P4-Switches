# Credit-Based-Flow-Control-Mechanisms-in-bmv2-P4-Switches
The project implements and evaluates credit-based flow control in P4 programmable switches using the bmv2 simulator. It aims to enhance network performance by dynamically managing buffer allocation, reducing congestion, and ensuring fair bandwidth distribution in SDN environments through flexible P4 programming.
